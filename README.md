# Map-London-Pub
A google map project to make the task of crawling around London's pubs easier on the ground

## TL:DR
This map is really a proof of concept piece. I've been getting to know the Google Maps API and created a quick list of 'pubs in the environs of Waterloo' to act as my data set. In reality, it should be used for much more sensible and useful things!
